Recently, I checked one of my codes which was committed on Codeplex and due to shutting down of Codeplex decided to move it to Github.

That code is related to e Payment module of Prestashop ver 1.3 and I didn’t want to commit it as a new project. So I need to commit it as a old project and it could be better to commit at the exact time when I developed.

There are two date variable which Git used to keep the time of commits:

GIT_COMMITTER_DATE
GIT_AUTHOR_DATE

you can change the time of commit with --date switch:

$ git commit --date='2011-12-03 12:12:45 -m 'commit message'

The --date switch only allows you to specify the author date (meaning only GIT_AUTHOR_DATE is modified, not GIT_COMMITTER_DATE)

Solution: to set a specific date export it to environment and then commit your code without --date switch ;)

export GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm"

export GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm"

$ git commit --date='2011-12-03 12:12:45 -m 'commit message'

You can see the result : https://github.com/M-Razavi/PrestaShop-MelliPayment (the commit time is before of joining to Github :D )
